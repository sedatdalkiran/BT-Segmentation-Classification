# CT-Segmentation-Classification


There are code parts of the model that we used to detect diseases using BT images in the "Artificial Intelligence Competition in Health" together with my teammate. We gave a new look to Brain Tomography Datasets by image processing. We classified this Datasets using Resnet and Efficient-Net B7 with Pytorch. We examined whether the brain image has the disease and by doing these we qualified
for the final.
